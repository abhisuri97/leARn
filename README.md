# leARn

LeARn was conceived around a simple notion: what if we could use Google Cardboards to create a cheap, dynamic, and useful educational tool? Any student that ever attended a primary or secondary school will know how intensely boring a chemistry or anatomy lecture can be. As we dozed off in these very same classes in high school, our experience sowed the seeds for what would become LeARn. This app has the potential to disrupt the way students view lectures, literally.

## What it does
LeARn allows users to interact with physics simulations, plot 3D graphs, view MRIs, and watch the molecular structure of a chemical compound float before their very eyes. The user can move and manipulate these projections via an online client, affecting factors like scale, rotation, and position. Most importantly, when, say, a teacher makes these changes, all other users viewing the same object will also see them take effect. This collaborative aspect is one of the key features of the application.

## How we built it
LeARn is built using a panoply of technologies. Unity/C#/Vuforia is used for 3D rendering, physics, and stereoscopic projection, JS/Node.js/Express.js/Socket.io is what keeps our backend running smoothly, and HTML/CSS/Materialize comprises our frontend stack.
